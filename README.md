- A CloudOps Engineer, with a strong foundation in AWS and CloudFormation, is responsible for managing and optimizing cloud infrastructure. This involves designing and deploying AWS resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. I create and configure various AWS services, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, ECS clusters, S3 buckets, and IAM policies, to meet application requirements.

Automation is at the core of their responsibilities. They develop and maintain automation scripts using java and python very good understanding the programming language , Shell scripting, and Ansible playbooks to streamline tasks and orchestrate deployments. Jenkins is leveraged for setting up CI/CD pipelines, automating application deployments, and ensuring efficient integration processes.

Monitoring and troubleshooting are also we have done . I used  AWS CloudWatch and third-party tools to monitor cloud resource availability and performance.When issues arise, they are quick to respond, troubleshoot, and we implements corrective action to maintain system health and minimize downtime.

Additionally, a I  collaborates with development teams to align infrastructure with application needs.Effective communication is key,ensuring that stakeholders are informed about changes and improvements in the cloud environment. I also focus on capacity planning and cost optimization, regularly monitoring resource utilization and making adjustments to save costs and maintain scalability.

In summary, I responsible for the design, automation, monitoring, security, and efficiency of AWS infrastructure, creating a robust and well-optimized environment for applications to thrive.
