- 📄As a Java developer, I have cultivated a wealth of experience in crafting robust and scalable applications that seamlessly integrate with AWS services. My proficiency in the Spring Framework has enabled me to design and implement microservices efficiently, utilizing Spring Boot to provide a solid foundation. I have harnessed the power of Spring JDBC and Spring RestTemplate for data access and external API interactions, respectively. My commitment to code quality and maintainability shines through my strong unit testing skills, with a test coverage of over 90% achieved through the use of JUnit and Mockito.

My Spring Boot skills have proven instrumental in developing RESTful APIs that facilitate effective communication between various system components. I have adeptly handled database interactions, employing the H2 database for local development and MySQL for production environments. In addition, I've honed my problem-solving skills by creating custom test data setup utilities using Spring JDBC for integration tests, ensuring data consistency and reliability throughout the development process.

My AWS expertise is a cornerstone of my development journey. I have effectively managed AWS resources, including EC2 instances for hosting applications, S3 buckets for efficient file storage, and RDS instances for seamless relational database management. My knowledge extends to AWS CloudShell, which I've used for command-line management of AWS resources, and CloudWatch for real-time monitoring, enabling me to identify and address performance bottlenecks swiftly.

In the realm of DevOps, I have actively contributed to AWS Cloud Pipelines, facilitating continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes. Leveraging AWS services such as CodePipeline, I've played a pivotal role in automating deployment workflows, ensuring efficient and reliable software releases. My ability to maintain and optimize AWS resources underscores my commitment to cost-efficiency and scalability, ensuring that cloud resources are utilized judiciously.
